# sql_data_warehouse_toy

## Project Description  
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **SQL-based Data Warehouse** to centralize, store, and analyze large volumes of data from multiple sources. The system integrates raw data through ETL/ELT pipelines, organizes it into structured schemas (star/snowflake models), and enables efficient querying for business intelligence and reporting.  

### Key Objectives  
- Build a scalable **data warehouse architecture**  
- Design **fact and dimension tables** for analytical queries  
- Implement **ETL/ELT processes** to extract, clean, and load data  
- Optimize queries using indexing, partitioning, and normalization/denormalization techniques  
- Support **data-driven decision-making** through dashboards and reports  

### Outcome  
By completing this project, the data warehouse provides a reliable foundation for advanced analytics, ensuring high performance, consistency, and accessibility of enterprise data.
